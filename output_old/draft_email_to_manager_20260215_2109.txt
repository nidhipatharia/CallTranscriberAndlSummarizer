Subject: Follow-up on Educational Institution Sales Call - February 12th

Dear [Manager's Name],

I wanted to provide you with a summary of my sales call with an educational institution representative on February 12th, as well as some insights on the deal potential.

Summary:

The customer is considering our website solution and has received a quote. They are also evaluating Pearson's offer for a biology solution. We discussed their concerns about the approval process and timeline, and I proposed sending an updated quote and scheduling another call to discuss discounts and approval timelines.

Deal Insights:

* The customer is interested in our website solution but wants to discuss internally with their team members before making a decision.
* They have received another quote from Pearson, which is faster and potentially better than ours. This may be a factor in their decision-making process.
* The customer seems to be looking for a comprehensive solution that meets their specific requirements.

Suggested Discount/Offerings:

Considering the customer's concerns about the approval process and timeline, I believe it would be beneficial to offer some flexibility on pricing or provide additional value-adds. Specifically, we could discuss:

* A revised quote with a more competitive price point
* A customized solution that addresses their specific needs
* A streamlined approval process with a dedicated project manager

I propose scheduling another call on February 19th to follow up on the customer's decision and provide an updated quote. This will give us an opportunity to address any remaining concerns and demonstrate our commitment to delivering a high-quality solution.

Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss further.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
